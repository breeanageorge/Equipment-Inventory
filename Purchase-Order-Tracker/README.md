# Purchase-Order-Tracker

This project is a sub-project of the equipment inventory project. This application is used to input and track purchase order information. This application was programmed using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS.

This application allows a higher level user to add a purchase order information to a few tables. During the adding process, the application will generate entries in the PO tracking table and the equipment tracking table. Once equipment is received, the entries in the equipment tracking table are updated with new information like location and serial numbers. As information is updated, it also updates the PO tracking landing page. This landing page shows how much of a PO has been received, how much is yet to be received, and specific equipment information.

## Goals and Challenges

The main goal of this project was to better track ordered equipment and the received status of purchase orders as well as show it in a user friendly manner.

Another goal of this project, much like the equipment inventory project, was to maintain correct data. An issue we saw previously with PO tracking was a lack of data, users would input most of the data for equipment, but would neglect adding the PO number which prevented us from tracking it properly. This application creates entries in both the PO tracking table and the equipment tracking table.
